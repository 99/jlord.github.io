# Getting Started in Web Development Guide

#### Development, JS, Web, Node

There are a lot of resources online for learning all the bits and bobs to do with web developement—aka making websites or web apps. I'm sure there are lots of good ones I've yet to see but I've been wanting for sometime to collect the ones I've found useful and well done into one place. Hopefully the brief introductions here will be helpful for the very new!

## General

Below are resources for things that have to do with coding but not quite the code itself. Things like keeping track of your work, sharing your work as open source and finding answers as you're learning.


### Find Answer on Anything

Odds are you're not the first person to make a bug or get hung up somewhere—this is good! A Google search is every developer's best friend. Favor results from:

- [Mozilla Developer Network](http://mdn.com) Mozilla have documented near everything.
- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) Someone who had your same problem got help and it's here.

### Frontend and Backend
Web browsers (like [Chrome](http://chrome.com) and [Safari](http://safari.com)) display information they receive from servers (basically [computers in warehouses](https://youtu.be/XZmGGAbHqa0?t=2m50s)). Code you create to run in the browser is referred to as **frontend** or **client side** (clients are the browsers used to visit your site). Code that sits on servers to tell the server what to give browsers when they request it is called **backend** or **server side**. Sections on each are below.

### Version Control
As you're learning about web development you're likely to come across [GitHub.com](https://github.com). This website stores code for users that are using [Git](http://git-scm.com), a **version control** (or **source code management**) system, with their work.

Version control allows you to track the changes you or others have made over time so that you can work efficiently (by not losing work and going back in time when you've made a mistake!). GitHub takes Git a step beyond by allowing you to view online the changes a project has seen (rather than reading terminal screens). It's a whole other thing to learn, however, with its own lingo, but you can do it!

- [Hello World Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world) A guide from GitHub to introduce you to the basic Git concepts and do them yourself just using the website.
- [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) The way that many use branches and pull requests to work with Git and each other.
- [Git-it](http://github.com/jlord/git-it) An app with lessons that teach you Git and GitHub on the command line (Terminal). Also, I wrote it!

### Open Source
Open source projects are ones that are available for anyone to use. Millions of open source projects are hosted GitHub, [look around](htts://github.com/explore). Many projects include the same type of basic files such as a readme (what is this project?), license (what are the terms?) and contributing (how can I help?) file. These are some resources for getting the lay of the open-source-project land.

- [Contributing to Open Source](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source) A GitHub guide on the basic elements of open source projects and community.

### Command line
Resources for using your computer's Terminal (or Bash) to complete tasks (copy files, move around folders, use git..) by just typing, well, commands.

## Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Design

Browsers, the medium of frontend work, understand HTML which organizes elements of a webpage, CSS which styles those elements and JavaScript which enables interaction. I'm also including here a section on design resources and inspiration and markdown, which is a way to quickly write text that includes elements like links and embedded images.

#### HTML & CSS

## Backend: Node.js
Servers can use many different types of languages, but the server side language I know is Node.js—JavaScript on a server—so my resources will relate to that.

### Backend Basics: Servers, APIs

- Looking for resource tip: How servers and browsers talk? (req, res, http)
- Looking for resource tip: What is an API?

### Node.js
