I&#39;m sure there are lots of good ones I&#39;ve yet to see but I&#39;ve been wanting for sometime to collect the ones I&#39;ve found useful and well done into one place. Hopefully the brief introductions here will be helpful for the very new!</p>
<p><small class="meta">Jump to <a href="#general">General</a> // Jump to <a href="#frontend-html-css-javascript-design">Frontend</a> // Jump to <a href="#backend-node-js">Backend</a></small></p>
<h2 id="general">General</h2>
<p>Below are resources for things that have to do with coding but not quite the code itself. Things like keeping track of your work, sharing your work as open source and finding answers as you&#39;re learning.</p>
<h3 id="find-answer-on-anything">Find Answer on Anything</h3>
<p>Odds are you&#39;re not the first person to make a bug or get hung up somewhere—this is good! A Google search is every developer&#39;s best friend. Favor results from:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mdn.com">Mozilla Developer Network</a> Mozilla have documented near everything.</li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> Someone who had your same problem got help and it&#39;s here.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="frontend-and-backend">Frontend and Backend</h3>
<p>Web browsers (like <a href="http://chrome.com">Chrome</a> and <a href="http://safari.com">Safari</a>) display information they receive from servers (basically <a href="https://youtu.be/XZmGGAbHqa0?t=2m50s">computers in warehouses</a>). Code you create to run in the browser is referred to as <strong>frontend</strong> or <strong>client side</strong> (clients are the browsers used to visit your site). Code that sits on servers to tell the server what to give browsers when they request it is called <strong>backend</strong> or <strong>server side</strong>. Sections on each are below.</p>
<h3 id="version-control">Version Control</h3>
<p>As you&#39;re learning about web development you&#39;re likely to come across <a href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</a>. This website stores code for users that are using <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a>, a <strong>version control</strong> (or <strong>source code management</strong>) system, with their work.</p>
<p>Version control allows you to track the changes you or others have made over time so that you can work efficiently (by not losing work and going back in time when you&#39;ve made a mistake!). GitHub takes Git a step beyond by allowing you to view online the changes a project has seen (rather than reading terminal screens). It&#39;s a whole other thing to learn, however, with its own lingo, but you can do it!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world">Hello World Guide</a> A guide from GitHub to introduce you to the basic Git concepts and do them yourself just using the website.</li>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">Understanding the GitHub Flow</a> The way that many use branches and pull requests to work with Git and each other.</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/jlord/git-it">Git-it</a> An app with lessons that teach you Git and GitHub on the command line (Terminal). Also, I wrote it!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="open-source">Open Source</h3>
<p>Open source projects are ones that are available for anyone to use. Millions of open source projects are hosted GitHub, <a href="htts://github.com/explore">look around</a>. Many projects include the same type of basic files such as a readme (what is this project?), license (what are the terms?) and contributing (how can I help?) file. These are some resources for getting the lay of the open-source-project land.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source">Contributing to Open Source</a> A GitHub guide on the basic elements of open source projects and community.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="command-line">Command line</h3>
<p>Resources for using your computer&#39;s Terminal (or Bash) to complete tasks (copy files, move around folders, use git..) by just typing, well, commands.</p>

<h2 id="frontend-html-css-javascript-design">Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript &amp; Design</h2>
<p>Browsers, the medium of frontend work, understand HTML which organizes elements of a webpage, CSS which styles those elements and JavaScript which enables interaction. I&#39;m also including here a section on design resources and inspiration and markdown, which is a way to quickly write text that includes elements like links and embedded images.</p>

          <div class="post-header"><a href="maps-kml.html"><h1>KML from Google Maps</h1></a><ul><li>By Jessica Lord</li> <li>2015-04-26</li> <li>maps, web dev</li></ul></div><div class="post-body"><p>I wanted to make a map of a <a href="https://jlord.exposure.co/rivendell-kaitoke">little trek</a> I did to Rivendell in New Zealand (NBD!). Here is what I learned about getting map data out of Google Maps (KML) to create a <a href="http://www.mapbox.com">Mapbox</a> map.</p>
<p><iframe width="100%" height="300px" frameBorder="0" src="https://a.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/jllord.m08a6002/attribution,zoompan,geocoder,share.html?access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoiamxsb3JkIiwiYSI6IkVwNUd4eWsifQ.dxpWPAYZle0eUvwXWGi8Cw"></iframe>
<em>Map of train, bus, walking and hiking from Wellington to Kaitoke and Rivendell in Wellington, NZ</em></p>
<p>Mapbox makes great software and beautiful maps (see above!). This is why I didn&#39;t attempt to just do the whole thing in Google Maps. I used Mapbox&#39;s online map making tool, <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/editor/#welcome">Editor</a>, which accepts <code>kml</code>, the format that Google Maps use. However:</p>
<p><em>You cannot export <code>kml</code> from regular maps.google.com.</em></p>
<p>I learned that the only way to export <code>kml</code> from Google Maps was to log in and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmapsengine.google.com%2Fmap%2Fmp%3Fhl%3Den%26authuser%3D0%26state%3Dcreate&amp;source=maps&amp;ei=3JQ9Vbr4OsmyogTA3IGoDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGErPyM4x5kFCq4MyvD9xRKN8C1zA&amp;sig2=65b8bK8VYjGHptwugnP0_A&amp;ved=0CAcQlTQoBQ">create a map in the My Maps</a> option. However:</p>
<p><em>The maps in My Maps do not support transit directions.</em></p>
<p>Which was a bummer because I was wanting to include the train and bus routes in my map. Fortunately the bus route was relatively simple so I opened it in Google Maps in one tab and then drew the route in My Maps by drawing lines that snap to roads (lines don&#39;t snap to roads in Mapbox Editor). I drew the train route with straight lines directly in Mapbox Editor.</p>
<p>Next, I selected to export as <code>kml</code>. Then selected the layer I wanted to export.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/2R3h0H1J0Z3r0C241P2G/export-google-maps-kml.png" alt="kml"></p>
<p>At this point you&#39;ll see that you actually get a compressed <code>kmz</code> rather than <code>kml</code>. You&#39;ll need to do a few things in order to get at that <code>kml</code>. Change the <code>kmz</code> extension to &#39;zip&#39; and unzip it. Inside you&#39;ll find a few files. You can do this via terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash"># copy it as a zip file, keeping original just in case
cp downloadedMap.kml downloadedMap.zip
# unzip it
unzip downloadedMap.zip
# rename it, if you want
mv doc.kml myMap.kml
</code></pre>
<p>Now you have a couple image files and a <code>doc.kml</code>. The latter is the <code>kml</code> you want. You may want to rename it at this point (especially if you&#39;re doing this multiple times) and trash the images. Now you can import this <code>kml</code> into Mapbox Editor and style it, hurray!</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/3w052f1T1E03460W0H0m/import-mapbox-editor.png" alt="import"></p>
<p>I also ended up using the Google My Maps to trace a path from satellite images because the Mapbox tiles didn&#39;t zoom in as close as I wanted. There was a lot of trial and error in my discovering each of these things and the map took way longer than it should have, so I hope this helps someone else!</p>
<p>Let me know if there are better ways of getting data from transit directions, snap-to-road lines and good satellite imagery (<a href="http://twitter.com/jllord">@jllord</a>).</p>

          <div class="post-header"><a href="patchwork-year.html"><h1>Patchwork Year!</h1></a><ul><li>Jessica Lord</li> <li>2015-01-22</li> <li>github, open source, git-it, reporobot</li></ul></div><div class="post-body"><p>A little over a year ago I volunteered to lead a community event at GitHub with the goal of helping new users make their first pull request. At GitHub we think a lot about how people learn to use Git/GitHub and as a stil-new-ish person in web development I think a lot too about how I can share what I&#39;ve learned in a way that is meaningful to someone else starting out. I was excited about the challenge.</p>
<p>We called it Patchwork because each of us in open source contributes pieces to something bigger, quite literally and metaphorically we make quilts. Props to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kelseyschimm">Kelsey</a> on this element.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/f.cl.ly/items/310g2d2U2Q0g2Y070k36/reporobotyear.png" alt="patches"></p>
<p><small>@reporobot&#39;s quilt of patches</small></p>
<p>Fresh off the heels of NodeConf 2013 and the first <a href="http://www.nodeschool.io">nodeschool.io</a> workshops, I decided to make a Git based workshop and thus <a href="https://github.com/jlord/git-it">Git-it</a> was born. But I couldn&#39;t teach people how to use GitHub without someone to collaborate with—and I couldn&#39;t feasibly review and merge each and every pull request that came in—so <a href="https://github.com/reporobot">@reporobot</a> was born. As of writing he&#39;s helped <strong>1493</strong> people on Git-it!</p>
<p><img src="https://i.github-camo.com/5b47a379d1899b1e0004fd944eef30fe88e91dc4/687474703a2f2f636c2e6c792f696d6167652f3057304f33463338315132412f756e6e616d65642d312e6a7067" alt="patchworksf"></p>
<p><small>photo by <a href="http://twitter.com/muanchoiu">@muanchoiu</a></small></p>
<p>So it was that a year ago we held the first Patchwork at GitHub&#39;s office in SF. It was nerve wracking for me (@reporobot was my first server!) but it went well, <em>whew</em>! We then had 14 more over the course of the 2014. GitHubbers hosted them where they were and we held Patchworks in London, Edinburgh, Nashville, Chicago, Columbus, Atlanta, New York City, Phoenix, Taipei, Tokyo and Boulder. Over <strong>700</strong> attendees!</p>
<p>We learned and iterated on the events. We used Git-it for some and then went web-based and command-line-free using the <a href="http://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world">Hello-World Guide</a>. Many props on content here to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tenaciouscb">Chrissie</a> who works with more GitHub users than probably anyone.</p>
<p>We added talks. An introduction from a GitHubber on their first pull request and how they got involved with open source—dispel any ideas that developers were born developers. We all started somewhere. A closing talk from a local open source developer to introduce projects and real world open source practices.</p>
<p><img src="http://jlord.us/git-it/assets/imgs/branches.png" alt="branch"></p>
<p><small>Branching</small></p>
<p>I&#39;m really proud of Patchwork. It&#39;s a simple event for sharing skills and giving back. Locals volunteered their time to come out and mentor attendees, to sit down and talk about branching like someone once did with them, and I am ever so grateful to all of you! Equally thankful to all the GitHubbers who attended, hosted and helped pull these off.</p>
<p>Patchwork keep going 2015 and be even better with full time dedication, so keep an eye out! I&#39;ll step back and cheer it on and continue in my spare time to maintain Git-it and @reporobot. More on that soon!</p>

If you have some questions about this module, you can <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/cli-boilerplate/issues">open an issue</a> on the repo.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>The module is <a href="https://github.com/jlord/cli-boilerplate">github.com/jlord/cli-boilerplate</a> and since this posting it&#39;s been updated (more features!) so I created a branch called</em> <code>tutorial</code> <em>on the repository, <a href="https://github.com/jlord/cli-boilerplate/tree/tutorial">here</a>, that matches the state of the project at the time of this writing to refer to as you read.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Before anything, of course you&#39;ll need <a href="http://www.nodejs.org">Node.js</a> and npm (which comes with the Node install). Now, begin!</p>
<h2 id="start-with-a-problem">Start with a Problem</h2>
<p>When I start a new website I usually go and dig up some boilerplate HTML. I wanted to make &quot;dig up&quot; a little less work and since the boilerplate isn&#39;t but a couple dozen lines or so I thought it would be nice if I could just type a command and have it copied to my clipboard so that I could paste it into a new file. This is how <code>cli-boilerplate</code> was born.</p>
<p>In terminal there is already a command for sending text to the clipboard and with Node we can read contents of files and execute terminal commands. So, let&#39;s begin!</p>
<h2 id="initialize">Initialize</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.npmjs.org">npm</a> (nice people matter) is Node.js&#39;s package manager. It&#39;s what you use if you want publish your project so that others can easily use it. It&#39;s a registry of all the published modules and their versions. You can see the latest activity here <a href="https://www.npmjs.org">npmjs.org</a> (at time of writing, 93,291 packages!). You can write projects in Node and run it on your computer without npm, but if you intend to publish it as we do, you&#39;ll use npm.</p>
<h3 id="npm-init">npm init</h3>
<p>Create a new folder for your project to live in. Now in your terminal, navigate to that folder and run <code>npm init</code>. This kicks off a process that gets your <code>package.json</code> file started for you.</p>
<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/170N1O2G1V0a263A2E37/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-07%20at%201.21.18%20PM.png" alt="npminit"></p>
<p>This file is like the title page, glossary, index and copyright page of a book rolled into one. You can get a sense of these files, and the JSON format, by checking out the <code>package.json</code> in existing projects (see <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/dat/blob/master/package.json">here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mikeal/request/blob/master/package.json">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-optimist/blob/master/package.json">here</a>).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash"># make a new folder
$ mkdir cli-boilerplate
# go inside of folder
$ cd cli-boilerplate
# initialize!
$ npm init
</code></pre>
<p>You can fill out the information in terminal or hit enter and fill it out later in your text editor. When it&#39;s done you&#39;ll have a <code>package.json</code> file in your folder.</p>
<h4 id="beyond-the-basics">Beyond the basics</h4>
<p>Because I want to create a module that runs from the command line, I need to add a section in my <code>package.json</code> called <code>bin</code> which will allow me to define what file gets run when <em>x</em> word (command) is typed into terminal. I chose <code>boilme</code>. Haaa. I also added where the repository and issues are on GitHub as well as keywords for when people search npmjs.org.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;cli-boilerplate&quot;,

<h2 id="create-the-boilerplate">Create the boilerplate</h2>
<p>We want to create the boilerplate HTML that we&#39;ll have copied to the clipboard for us when this module is used. This is easy as creating a new HTML file and filling it with the boilerplate:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-HTML">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=edge&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; href=&quot;favicon.png&quot;&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;assets/style.css&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="write-the-code">Write the code</h2>
<p>Now we&#39;ll create the actual code in a file named <code>index.js</code>, which is a common name for your main file. Below is the full code, it&#39;s pretty short! A lot of node modules are simple and do just one thing, like this one. We&#39;ll go through each part.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">#!/usr/bin/env node

var fs   = require(&#39;fs&#39;)
var path = require(&#39;path&#39;)
var exec = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).exec

fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, &#39;boilerplate.html&#39;), function read(err, data) {
  if (err) return console.log(err)
  var command = &quot;echo &#39;&quot; + data.toString() + &quot;&#39; | pbcopy&quot;
  exec(command, function clipboarded(err, stdout, stdrr) {
    if (err) return console.log(err)
    console.log(&quot;Copied!&quot;)
  })
})
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-environment">The Environment</h3>
<p>At the very top we use <code>#!/usr/bin/env node</code>. Remember in <code>package.json</code> we set &quot;./index.js&quot; as the file we wanted to run after someone types <code>boilme</code>? Using this line at the top of <code>index.js</code> tells the computer when it starts to read it that it should execute — <code>#!/</code> (shebang) — the code below it and do so using Node.</p>
<h3 id="require-other-modules">Require other modules</h3>
<p>Node.js comes with a <a href="http://nodejs.org/api/">core set of modules</a> that help you do lots of things. If there is something that is outside of the scope of core, that&#39;s when you&#39;ll use npm to find something created by someone else.</p>
<p>This project, being simple, just uses core modules. In this section we are requiring the core modules we want and giving them a name:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var fs   = require(&#39;fs&#39;)
var path = require(&#39;path&#39;)
var exec = require(&#39;child_process&#39;).exec
</code></pre>
<p>When you require a module, all of the functions inside of it become accessible to you in your code through the name you set for it. For instance, I can use the things that come with <code>fs</code> when I use the variable <code>fs</code> in my script.</p>
<p><strong>fs</strong> is a module for the file system, letting us read or write files (and more!) on a computer</p>
<p><strong>path</strong> is a utility for working with file paths (locations)</p>
<p><strong>child_process</strong> allows us to run another process, outside of the one we&#39;re already in. Using the <code>exec</code> part of it allows us to specifically run a shell (command line) process</p>
<h3 id="action-">Action!</h3>
<p>Next we&#39;ll actually use this modules to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the contents of the boilerplate HTML file.</li>
<li>Create a <em>string</em> of the command we&#39;d type in terminal if we were manually giving it text to send to the clipboard.</li>
<li>Use <code>exec</code> to create a shell process and give it our command to run.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#39;s break it down some more. Here is all the code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, &#39;boilerplate.html&#39;), function read(err, data) {
  if (err) return console.log(err)
  var command = &quot;echo &#39;&quot; + data.toString() + &quot;&#39; | pbcopy&quot;
  exec(command, function clipboarded(err, stdout, stdrr) {
    if (err) return console.log(err)
    console.log(&quot;Copied!&quot;)
  })
})
</code></pre>
<h4 id="read-file">Read file</h4>
<p>We use <code>fs</code> to read the file, it wants to know where the file is and what to do after it has read it, the callback. The callback is a function that is run after the main task (reading the file contents) has completed. It will automatically get passed in first an error, if there was one, and the the contents of the file, but buffered, which means numbers (we&#39;ll change that later). Here&#39;s what the basic format looks like: <code>fs.readFile(&#39;filelocation&#39;, callback)</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>boilerplate.html</code> will be located wherever this module exists on the users computer, so we&#39;ll use <code>__dirname</code> to get the location of the module on the computer and <code>path.join</code> to add <code>boilerplate.html</code> to that. That gives us the full address of the file on the computer.</p>
<p>Then we pass in our callback, a function we create called &#39;read&#39; because it&#39;s going to get run when the file has finished being read. Next is a common pattern in Node -- we check to see if there were any errors reading the file. If there were, we want give up because there&#39;s no use doing the rest of the work. So if there is an error, we return, but we print with <code>console.log()</code>out what the error was.</p>
<p>But, if there were no errors, we&#39;ll move right along!</p>
<h4 id="run-copy-command">Run copy command</h4>
<p>We create a string to contain what the full command would be in terminal if we were doing this manually. In Mac terminals you can type <code>echo &quot;Hello World!&quot;</code> and it will print out the string you gave it. You can feed that text directly into another function using a &quot;pipe&quot; which is this &quot;|&quot; character. We want to feed it into the copy command which is <code>pbcopy</code> on Macs. So typing <code>echo &quot;Hello World!&quot; | pbcopy</code> will put &quot;Hello World&quot; in our clipboard and and the next time we paste, we&#39;ll get &quot;Hello World&quot;.</p>
<p>Since <code>fs.readFile</code> returns a buffer of numbers, we&#39;ll use the JavaScript method <code>.toString()</code> to turn it into the letters and spaces we recognize.</p>
<p>Using <code>exec</code> we spawn a new independent shell process to which we can give our shell command. It also takes in a callback, a function for what to do after it&#39;s run that command. We want it to quit and print the error if there was an error, but if there was no error, print &quot;Copied!&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="try-it-out-and-publish">Try it out and Publish</h2>
<p>Now that the file is done, we can test it by running it on our computer. If we&#39;re in the <code>cli-clipboard</code> directory we can type <code>npm link</code> so that npm will use this version we&#39;ve made as the global module.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ cd cli-clipboard
$ npm link
# it will print text about the linkage
$ boilme
# it should work!
</code></pre>
<p>Next publish what you&#39;ve done to your npm account (if you don&#39;t have one, <a href="https://www.npmjs.org/signup">set one up</a>):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">$ npm publish
</code></pre>
<h2 id="tada">Tada</h2>
<p>That&#39;s the whole thing! We have a <code>package.json</code> so that we can register our module with npm and others can use it, we have our <code>boilerplate.html</code> file with our dream boilerplate, and we have the itty bitty <code>index.js</code> script to make what we want to happen, happen.</p>
<p>This post is way longer than I thought it would be. I tried to save space and didn&#39;t mention it, but you should also being using Git when you&#39;re building something and checking-in often to save your work and push it to GitHub.</p>
<h3 id="other-files">Other files</h3>
<p>The project also has a <code>README.md</code> and <code>LICENSE.md</code> file. They&#39;re not required to make a module, but they&#39;re really important files to have in a project. The former tells people how to use your project and the later shows the license the project is under. Some places can&#39;t use un-licensed projects, so it&#39;s important to add one!</p>

          <div class="post-header"><a href="gh-one-year.html"><h1>365 days a GitHubber</h1></a><ul><li>Jessica Lord</li> <li>2014-05-15</li> <li>GitHub, Development</li></ul></div><div class="post-body"><p>I&#39;ve been at <a href="http://www.github.com/about">GitHub</a> a year! That&#39;s 365 days of learning, laughing and working on something I care about. That&#39;s lucky!</p>
<p>A little over two years ago I was an urban designer for a lovely city on the east coast. Then I spent 2012 as a Code for America <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org">fellow</a> and fell hard for open source and GitHub. </p>
<p>Open source and GitHub were the community and mindset missing from my way of working before, only I didn&#39;t know it then. I did know, however, that I wanted to build more and ship more (only I didn&#39;t know it was called &#39;ship&#39; then). Hello, GitHub!</p>
<p>Now not only do I get to use GitHub everyday but I get to be a part of making GitHub as great as it can be — the tool, the company, the community. And I get to do this with an amazing group of people that are talented, passionate and hilarious. They inspire me with code and wit every day.</p>
<p>I work in particular on making GitHub.com better for new users and that gets me pretty jazzed. I remember quite well what it is like to be a new user and new to open source. I remember searching (and still do — because, never stop learning) for resources online to learn new things. I want to help others improve the way they work with GitHub, I want others to come to GitHub and start contributing to open source. I love working on the tools to help people do that.</p>
<p>The more people out there building things and working together, the better.</p>
<p>But the big, big thing for me working at GitHub has been that, more than I realized could be possible at the place you work, I know my coworkers want to see me happy and succeeding. I am myself everyday. I truly feel appreciated and that I have impact and potential. I try not to take these things for granted.</p>
<p>I thought I&#39;d return to urban design after CfA but when I decided to work at GitHub I was also deciding to keep doing this software development thing. It&#39;s crazy to think about what I know now compared to what I knew a year ago. I&#39;ve learned so much. I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do so if it  weren&#39;t for a company that shares my goals, champions people and gives me the freedom to shape my experience. I want to keep learning (more Node and even some Rails), keep spreading the knowledge (<a href="https://github.com/blog/1805-patchwork-night">Patchwork</a> nights! <a href="http://guides.github.com">Guides</a>!) and I&#39;m proud to do it as a <a href="https://github.com/blog/1504-jessica-lord-is-a-githubber">GitHubber</a>.</p>
