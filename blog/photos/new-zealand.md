I learned that the only way to export `kml` from Google Maps was to log in and [create a map in the My Maps](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmapsengine.google.com%2Fmap%2Fmp%3Fhl%3Den%26authuser%3D0%26state%3Dcreate&source=maps&ei=3JQ9Vbr4OsmyogTA3IGoDg&usg=AFQjCNGErPyM4x5kFCq4MyvD9xRKN8C1zA&sig2=65b8bK8VYjGHptwugnP0_A&ved=0CAcQlTQoBQ) option. However:

_The maps in My Maps do not support transit directions._

Which was a bummer because I was wanting to include the train and bus routes in my map. Fortunately the bus route was relatively simple so I opened it in Google Maps in one tab and then drew the route in My Maps by drawing lines that snap to roads (lines don't snap to roads in Mapbox Editor). I drew the train route with straight lines directly in Mapbox Editor.

Next, I selected to export as `kml`. Then selected the layer I wanted to export.
