That&#39;s 365 days of learning, laughing and working on something I care about. That&#39;s lucky!</p>
<p>A little over two years ago I was an urban designer for a lovely city on the east coast. Then I spent 2012 as a <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a> fellow and fell hard for open source and GitHub. </p>
<p>Open source and GitHub were the community and mindset missing from my way of working before, only I didn&#39;t know it then. I did know, however, that I wanted to build more and ship more (only I didn&#39;t know it was called &#39;ship&#39; then). Hello, GitHub!</p>
<p>Now not only do I get to use GitHub everyday but I get to be a part of making GitHub as great as it can be — the tool, the company, the community. And I get to do this with an amazing group of people that are talented, passionate and hilarious. They inspire me with code and wit every day.</p>
<p>I work in particular on making GitHub.com better for new users and that gets me pretty jazzed. I remember quite well what it is like to be a new user and new to open source. I remember searching (and still do — because, never stop learning) for resources online to learn new things. I want to help others improve the way they work with GitHub, I want others to come to GitHub and start contributing to open source. I love working on the tools to help people do that.</p>
<p>The more people out there building things and working together, the better.</p>
<p>But the big, big thing for me working at GitHub has been that, more than I realized could be possible at the place you work, I know my coworkers want to see me happy and succeeding. I am myself everyday. I truly feel appreciated and that I have impact and potential. I try not to take these things for granted.</p>
<p>I thought I&#39;d return to urban design after CfA but when I decided to work at GitHub I was also deciding to keep doing this software development thing. It&#39;s crazy to think about what I know now compared to what I knew a year ago. I&#39;ve learned so much. I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do so if it  weren&#39;t for a company that shares my goals, champions people and gives me the freedom to shape my experience. I want to keep learning (more Node and even some Rails), keep spreading the knowledge (<a href="https://github.com/blog/1805-patchwork-night">Patchwork</a> nights! <a href="http://guides.github.com">Guides</a>!) and I&#39;m proud to do it as a <a href="https://github.com/blog/1504-jessica-lord-is-a-githubber">GitHubber</a>.</p>
