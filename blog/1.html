<p>I&#39;ve just updated <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js">Sheetsee.js</a> with new features and all new docs. I&#39;ve been waiting to ship this, it feels like, for far too long. I&#8217;m hoping now Sheetsee is at a solid enough place that I can focus spare time on making more <a href="http://www.jlord.us/fork-n-go">fork-n-go</a> examples.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll get straight to the most exciting point: the new <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao5u1U6KYND7dGN5QngweVJUWE16bTRob0d2a3dCbnc&amp;usp=drive_web&amp;pli=1#gid=0">sample data</a> for the demos is of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessllord/sets/72157640471928365/">flattened penny collection</a>. Below are the other things.</p>
<h3 id="new-features">New Features</h3>
<p>Yay!</p>
<h4 id="tables-pagination-multi-table-sorting-and-filtering">Tables: Pagination, Multi Table Sorting and Filtering</h4>
<p>Tables can now be paginated so that you don&#8217;t have to display your entire spreadsheet of data in one go. Unless you want to.</p>
<p>Tables now supports having multiple tables with sorting and filtering. So long as you keep your table IDs straight, you&#8217;re golden.</p>
See: <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js/demos/demo-table.html">table demo</a>
<h4 id="maps-polygons-and-lines">Maps: Polygons and Lines</h4>
<p>Maps now support polygons and lines. So long as you have the correct coordinate structure in your cells, Sheetsee will add them to the geoJSON it creates for your maps. More details for coordinates of lines and polygons in geoJSON are <a href="http://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson.html">here</a>, but briefly:</p>
<p>A linestring:</p>
<pre><code>[-122.41722106933594, 37.7663045891584], [-122.40477561950684, 37.77695634643178]
</code></pre><p>A polygon:</p>
<pre><code>[-122.41790771484375, 37.740381166384914], [-122.41790771484375, 37.74520008134973], [-122.40966796874999, 37.74520008134973],[-122.40966796874999, 37.740381166384914], [-122.41790771484375, 37.740381166384914]
</code></pre><p>A Multipolygon:</p>
<pre><code>[[-122.431640625, 37.79106586542567], [-122.431640625, 37.797441398913286], [-122.42666244506835, 37.797441398913286],[-122.42666244506835, 37.79106586542567], [-122.431640625, 37.79106586542567]],
[[-122.43352890014648, 37.78197638783258], [-122.43352890014648, 37.789031004883654], [-122.42443084716797, 37.789031004883654], [-122.42443084716797, 37.78197638783258], [-122.43352890014648, 37.78197638783258]]
</code></pre><p>See: <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js/demos/demo-map.html">map demo</a>.</p>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>I redid the documentation and website for Sheetsee. Instead of one <em>gigantic</em> readme file/website, all of the different elements are given their own file/page. Now you can find docs, demos, tips and such all filed away nicely here in the <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js">repository</a> and on the <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js">website</a>.</p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>The other big thing that has happened to Sheetsee is that I&#39;ve taken each component (core, maps, tables and charts) and made them into their own Node.js module. This makes for smaller, more manageable code files and it makes it so that users can build their own version of Sheetsee with just the elements they want to use. For instance, if you&#39;re only making maps, just build a Sheetsee with the map component.</p>
<p>All builds come with the <code>sheetsee-core</code> module which contains all of the data organizing functions.</p>
<p>The module <code>sheetsee</code> is a command line module that builds your custom sheetsee for you.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not interested in Node modules or building anything, that&#39;s ok, too. I&#39;ll always keep a full build (with all the components) here in <a href="https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js/tree/master/js">the sheetsee.js repository</a> (which from here on out exists to be the consolidated documentation and source of a full build).</p>
<p>If you need to file an issue for a bug or feature, try and file it on the repository with the component it relates to (they each have their own repository now):</p>

<p>There are lots of ways you can take data from you Google Spreadsheet and use it in a website in cool ways. I&#8217;m going to do a few posts on such things. Neat!</p>
<p>If your spreadsheet contains address information, using templates (<a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js">Sheetsee.js</a> uses a form of <a href="https://github.com/janl/mustache.js">Mustache</a>), you can embed those elements into a Google Maps URL query string (this is the same URL that is generated when you type in an address into the search bar yourself) and create links/buttons that will open locations up directly in Google Maps on desktops and phones. Similarly you can put them in Yelp queries, too.</p>
<p>The basic elements are: <em>a spreadsheet with address info + HTML template to create the query string</em>.</p>
<h3 id="par-exemple">Par Exemple</h3>
<p>The Sheetsee <a href="http://jlord.github.io/hack-spots/">Hack-Spots</a> is an does such a thing. Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao5u1U6KYND7dFVkcnJRNUtHWUNKamxoRGg4ZzNiT3c#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>, with address information:</p>
<p><img src="http://jlord.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-09-15-at-6.49.19-PM.png" alt="spreadsheet"></p>
<p>In the HTML template for the table on the <a href="http://jlord.github.io/hack-spots/">Hack-Spots page</a>, the button&#39;s links look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-HTML">&lt;a class=&quot;button&quot; href=&quot;https://maps.google.com/maps?q={{address}},{{city}},{{state}}&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;View in Google Maps&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;button&quot; href=&quot;http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc={{name}}&amp;find_loc={{city}},{{state}}&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Find on Yelp&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jlord/hack-spots/blob/gh-pages/index.html#L62">Here</a> is the exact line of code on GitHub.</p>
<p>We&#39;re inserting the <strong>address</strong>, <strong>city</strong>, and <strong>state</strong> details from the spreadsheet into the structure of a query string for Google maps and Yelp. You can figure out the query string of a service by just using it (type in an address in Google Maps) and looking at the resulting URL.</p>
<p>With a some CSS and such, the resulting website has a table with the hack spots and a button for viewing in Google Maps or Yelp:</p>
<p><img src="http://jlord.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2013-09-15-at-6.43.54-PM.png" alt="table"></p>
<p>When the page builds, it creates the correct link for each row. When someone clicks on the buttons it takes them directly to the Google Map search result for that address. BAM!</p>
</div>
        
          <div class="post-header"><a href="fork-n-go.html"><h1>Fork-n-go</h1></a><ul><li>Jessica Lord</li> <li>2013-08-11</li> <li>github, pages, open source, sheetsee.js</li></ul></div><div class="post-body"><p><img src="http://jlord.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/forkngoheader.png" alt="fork-n-go"></p>
<p>I began <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js">Sheetsee</a> last year as an effort to make wider use of existing, free and easy to use web technologies. I&#39;m always hacking on it and always trying to make it easier to use.</p>
<p><img src="http://jlord.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/ss-diagram.png" alt="ss diagram"></p>
<p>I think that using a Google Spreadsheet as a database can quickly and easily solve a lot of the initial barriers to getting-going that prevent even savy developers from starting even a simple website if it requires a database. More so I think that using Google Spreadsheet as a database can bring simple and easy control to many people.</p>
<p>Because you can easily pick contributors, viewers; share raw or connect to a Google Form - collaborating on information can become really, really easy. When connected to a templated website, the information becomes more meaningful.</p>
<p>Currently there is <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee-cache">sheetsee-cache</a>, a node.js caching version, <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js">Sheetsee</a>, the basic client-side version which is much more accessible. Recently I&#39;ve started getting excited about an iteration even more approachable, making use of the free and easy hosting through <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p><strong>All it takes to get a website going for a repository on GitHub is a branch named gh-pages containing web files. You also don&#8217;t need a master branch, you can have a repo with just one branch named gh-pages. Here is what I think is really cool, if you fork a project with just a gh-pages branch, you&#8217;re only a commit away from having a live version yourself. If this repo being forked is using sheetsee.js then everyone is a fork, commit and spreadsheet away from having a live website connected to an easy (a familiar spreadsheet UI and no &#39;publish&#39; flow because Google autosaves) to use database that they manage (control permissions, review revision history).</strong></p>
<h3 id="hack-spots">Hack Spots</h3>
<p><img src="http://jlord.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/hack-spots-ss.png" alt="hack-spots"></p>
<p>For example, I made <a href="http://jlord.github.io/hack-spots">this website</a> to collect hack spots all over the world from friends and friends of friends (the spreadsheet is wide open, so you can add some, too!). It&#39;s using sheetsee to power the table, map and other elements of the page. Its source is in <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/hack-spots">this repo</a>, with just a gh-pages branch. To create an instance of this site for yourself all you need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Google spreadsheet with the same headers (just copy and paste header row from the original).</li>
<li>Fork the original source.</li>
<li>Edit the HTML file directly on GitHub.com to replace the original spreadsheet&#8217;s unique key with your spreadsheet&#8217;s key (found in your spreadsheet&#8217;s URL).</li>
<li>Commit your change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you have the same site connected to a spreadsheet that you manage - it&#39;s live and can be found at <em>yourGitHubName.github.io/theReposName</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://jlord.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/forkcommit1.png" alt="fork and commit"> </p>
<h3 id="potential">Potential</h3>
<p>I think there could be many potential uses for web developers and designers to use this for small projects that catch their fancy, but I&#39;m really interested in this as a way to make creating a live website with collaborative data available to people who think setting up a website is far beyond their grasp (or not free). All it takes is a designer/developer to create one working version for a use case to enable many to easily replicate it. Could this help civic organizers? Cities? Neighborhood groups?</p>
<p><img src="http://jlord.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/lending-ss.png" alt="tool lending"></p>
<p>So I&#39;m wondering, what are the possible use cases? For instance, I&#39;m currently working on a site for <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee-tool-lending">managing lending tools</a> in a group of friends or neighborhood. This information can be easily stored in a spreadsheet but made much more useable through a website. Any group could use the steps mentioned above and get this going for themselves in minutes. No installation and after one person forks the site, all other collaborators only need interact with the spreadsheet.</p>
<p><em>Edit:</em> Also! There are lots of  automation into Google spreadsheets possibilities through <a href="https://ifttt.com/">ifttt.com</a> (which I use for the Pocket reads and Instagrams on the <a href="http://jlord.us">front</a> of my site).</p>
<p>Hit me up on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jllord">Twitter</a>, <a href="mailto:to.jlord@gmail.com">email</a> or on <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord">GitHub</a> if you&#39;ve got thoughts or ideas for this!</p>

          <div class="post-header"><a href="dat.html"><h1>Dat</h1></a><ul><li>By Jessica Lord</li> <li>2013-07-03</li> <li>web dev, open data, science, gov</li></ul></div><div class="post-body"><p><img src="http://jlord.s3.amazonaws.com/dat-diagram.png" alt="dat diagram"></p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I know <a href="http://twitter.com/maxogden">@maxogden</a> very well, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I like everything that he does. But I do like <a href="http://www.github.com/maxogden/dat">Dat</a>.</em></p>
<p>It&#39;s really exciting to see all the discussion that&#39;s started based on one <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/dat#dat">GitHub readme</a>. The more perspectives, the better Dat will be. In the back and forth I&#39;ve noticed a few misunderstandings about Dat and as it often goes for me, I felt the urge to diagram.</p>
<p>The diagram above illustrates that Dat will be an ecosystem of modules that can be tacked on and synced with different datasets; importantly, this includes very big datasets. Modules and combination of modules can be shared. These modules will use a common API but can be written in any language and hosted anywhere. The ecosystem exists for the benefit of data consumers and lives outside the realm of data producers.</p>
<h3 id="dat-and-government">Dat and Government</h3>
<p>Dat is being built to solve a problem that exists today without a good solution: collaborating on really large datasets and sharing data transformations. While Dat can be used by anyone and government certainly fits the <em>anyone</em> bucket, it isn&#39;t <em>a new tool for government</em>. It is a <strong>new tool for those who work everyday with data</strong>, government or other.</p>
<p>Because Dat will be a platform that works with <strong>any</strong> type of tabular data, it prefers no one type, it is completely <strong>independent of the government data standards and liberation efforts</strong> that are ongoing. And yes, this effort is a cultural effort. I <a href="http://jlord.us/a-government-more-like-the-people/">know this to be very true</a> as I&#39;ve been involved with government all of my career from the City of Boston to Code for America (<a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/apply">apply now</a>!) and am still active in this important cultural shift.</p>
<p>Dat will exist outside of and in parallel to whatever comes of this effort and therefore will work no matter what standards emerge from the effort; that&#39;s awesome!</p>
<h3 id="build-dat">Build Dat</h3>
<p>Because nothing like Dat exists today, I absolutely believe someone should give something like Dat a go. I believe we should always try to make things -- because things make other, better things possible. E.O Wilison says it much more eloquently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason is that the adoption of any one innovation made adoption of certain others possible, which then, if useful, were more likely to spread. Bands and communities of bands with better combinations of cultural innovations became more productive and better equipped for competition and war. <em>Wilson, Edward O. (2012-04-02). The Social Conquest of Earth (Kindle Locations 1496-1498). Norton. Kindle Edition</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="git">Git</h3>
<p>Remember, Git wasn&#39;t the first version control and most of us wouldn&#39;t know it like we do today if weren&#39;t that years after it was built someone built an interface on top of it.</p>
<p>While Git works for many of us, it doesn&#39;t work for everyone. And those that it doesn&#39;t work for are doing awesome work in the civic, science or legal space. They have huge, huge datasets that move slow on Git. They have realtime data constantly updating and yielding too many commits for Git to handle. They have no good way to share this data or the transformation algorithms they used. This transformation algorithm aspect is really awesome because it also helps the majority of us who work with small or medium sized datasets that are routinely published in the same file and text formats that require frequent transforming. With Dat you can create a transformation module in your favorite language that can be hooked up to your data sync so that you don&#39;t have to constantly re-transform -- and you can share that modules with others. It&#39;s simply a script hosted somewhere. There is a <a href="https://github.com/blog/1504-jessica-lord-is-a-githubber">place for hosting code</a> that I love.</p>
<h3 id="open-community-built">Open + Community Built</h3>
<p>I&#39;m excited that Dat will not only be built in the open but embody its own ideals and be structured so that contributing is easy. Similar to <a href="http://www.npmjs.org">NPM</a>, the package manager for the <a href="http://www.nodejs.org">Node.js</a> community, Dat will be made up of small modules related through a common API. The community can submit modules to transform data or submit pull requests to the API. There are already <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/dat/pulls?direction=desc&amp;page=1&amp;sort=created&amp;state=closed">pull requests</a> and <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/dat/issues">issues</a> (and forks?!) on the readme.</p>
<h3 id="-3">&lt;3</h3>
<p>Dat doesn&#39;t change how groups are publishing data -- it changes how people interact with it and share it with others.  I can&#39;t wait to see what comes from all the brains on this!</p>

<h2 id="announcement-">ANNOUNCEMENT!</h2>
<p>Thanks to a <a href="http://sinker.tumblr.com/post/46934949919/opennews-code-sprints-in-2013">Code Sprint Grant</a> from Knight-Mozilla&#39;s Open News I&#39;m going to spend lots of time making sheetsee.js all that it can be!</p>
<p><a href="http://jlord.github.com/sheetsee.js/">Sheetsee.js</a> is Google spreadsheet and visualization mashup I built as a part of my project, <a href="http://seepennywork.in">See Penny Work</a>, during my fellowship with <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a> last year. The goal for sheetsee.js is to use Google spreadsheets as an easy way to store, serve and collaborate on data all the while feeding it into a website that visualizes the data. Once the website and spreadsheet are connected (<a href="http://www.onholdinc.com/mohblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/showtime.jpg!">set it and forget it</a> you only need to interact with the spreadsheet; add another row and with every autosave your website reflects the changes. No pushing or uploading, no teaching collaborators anything more than the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Currently it&#39;s built really specifically for its original instance in my CfA project. I&#39;ll be spending the next two months making it much more general and adding features like more visualizations out of the box, data caching, data filters, responsiveness and other exciting stuff.</p>
<p>It will be built with news organizations in mind -- a template for small and medium newsrooms to customize and be able to deploy quickly. And WBEZ is the guinea pig! But, as I mentioned, I&#39;m making it really general and can I imagine many other instances in communities or small groups where this would be useful (in particular, community collected data). I&#39;ve got some side projects in mind for it, too.
Related, I&#39;ll be at coffee shops in Oakland a lot in the near future, join and hack!</p>
<p><strong>Lots of thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/dansinker">Dan Sinker</a> for making things happen!</strong></p>
