Luckily, this coincided with my meeting some 2011 Code for America fellows. Less than a year later I&#8217;d be in California for the first time and working on government technology from a different, and more personally satisfying, angle.</p>
<p>There is a great gulf between where we are as a society in terms of technology, connectedness and new efficiencies and where government sits in respect to the same. This gulf has become apparent enough that it is the subject of <a title="Gavin Newsom Citizinville" href="http://www.amazon.com/Citizenville-Square-Digital-Reinvent-Government/dp/1594204721/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1364746242&sr=8-1&keywords=gavin+newsom" target="_blank">books</a>, <a title="Clay Shirky TED Talk" href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CDsQtwIwAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ted.com%2Ftalks%2Fclay_shirky_how_the_internet_will_one_day_transform_government.html&ei=1V9YUfzEH6asigKkmIHQDw&usg=AFQjCNGuI4iLD4GpIe1MNxUrV0whSfcwtA&bvm=bv.44442042,d.cGE" target="_blank">talks</a>, <a title="Code for America" href="http://www.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">fellowships</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s now a movement.</p>
<p>While after almost 4+ years willfully in the trenches of government technology I have more war stories than success stories, I&#8217;m still optimistic. This is because we&#8217;re at a unique place. A revolutionary kind of place. For the first time <strong>we the people</strong> have the capacity to hold government accountable in a meaningful way. The tools we use in our everyday lives often empower us to understand our cites better than those at City Hall.</p>
<p>The movement is a result from the pressure the gulf places on government. Government hasn&#8217;t put pressure on itself to get better &#8211; this movement comes from the people. I believe we&#8217;re at the beginning of a sea change.</p>
<p>There are many reasons government hasn&#8217;t kept up: tight budgets, the expectation to be unflappable and the correlated risk aversion, siloed departments, aging staff and skills and the lack of competition. These reasons and more are being directly challenged by the fact that our lives outside of government have been dramatically changed by the technology of the last 20 years.</p>
<h3 id="tight-budgets-open-source-saas-google-et-al">Tight Budgets : Open Source, SaaS, Google et al</h3>
<p>The open source community is thriving &#8211; there&#8217;s even an <a title="Code for America on GitHub" href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/" target="_blank">civic tech open source community</a>. The software being built is good and if it&#8217;s not free it&#8217;s <a title="See Click Fix" href="http://seeclickfix.com/" target="_blank">sold as a service</a> for what&#8217;s still a bargain. It&#8217;s often continuously maintained &#8211; that means free upgrades. Why on Earth would a cash strapped city still shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars for long term binding contracts on software that&#8217;s probably out of date as soon as they get it?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even if you get a city that wants to go the open source route, procurement standards hold them hostage and keep small companies out of competition with enterprises. <a title="EZ RFP" href="http://presidential-innovation-fellows.github.com/rfpez-blog/" target="_blank">People</a> are working on that.</p>
<p>An even brighter area of possibility is all of the free services many of us take for granted that haven&#8217;t yet penetrated City Hall. I&#8217;m talking about making <a title="Google" href="http://www.google.com/drive/start/apps.html#fusiontables" target="_blank">maps, charts and forms</a> through Google, creating a website for a project or department on <a title="Wordpress" href="http://www.wordpress.com" target="_blank">WordPress</a> or <a title="Tumblr" href="http://www.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>. Storing and cataloguing photographs on <a title="Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com" target="_blank">Flickr</a>. These services are tried and true at this point, are free or almost free and best of all make it really, really easy to share.</p>
<h3 id="risk-aversion-prototypes">Risk Aversion : Prototypes</h3>
<p>The government must remain to some degree risk adverse &#8211; private information must be secure and City Halls mustn&#8217;t crumble. But there is enough room to play in to keep everyone busy for a while.</p>
<p>If New York City&#8217;s <a title="NYC" href="http://sf.streetsblog.org/2010/02/11/new-york-citys-broadway-pedestrian-zone-to-become-permanent/" target="_blank">Broadway pedestrian zone</a> hasn&#8217;t already made this clear: some street paint can go a long way. Low cost, temporary changes are a great way of making positive change or staying away from costly, permanent mistakes. And no doubt the quicker action makes for a happy citizen, too. A more agile government can benefit all.</p>
<p>Sites like <a title="Neighborland" href="https://neighborland.com/" target="_blank">Neighborland</a>, <a title="Neighborly" href="http://neighbor.ly/" target="_blank">Neighbor.ly</a> and <a title="Better Block" href="http://betterblock.org/" target="_blank">Better Block</a> are full of many relatively (compared to typical city projects) easy to initiate ideas and some of the free services mentioned earlier can help facilitate prototype projects.</p>
<h3 id="competition-be-the-best-">Competition : Be the Best!</h3>
<p>Cities do not have to compete to be the government for the city. And if you&#8217;re not the Mayor there is a good chance you can keep your job for 20, 30 years whether you learn new things or not. So while private firms handling tasks similar to those of cities like urban planning, payments and record keeping kept on top of changes in standards, City Hall did not. I think this is a large part of why we are where we are today.</p>
<p>Be a more innovative, open and agile city than that other city. Sick as I am of these buzzwords already, I think the movement has finally given cities something to compete for, lest be publicly shamed and left behind. Hopefully in time the buzz-factor will yield real institutional change by promoting innovation and professional development.</p>
<p>I hope that this happens and eventually the insides of City Halls become more attractive to developers and civic tech becomes exciting for entrepreneurs.</p>
<h3 id="silos-distributed-source-control">Silos : Distributed Source Control</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s sad and it&#8217;s frustrating how many situations boil down to lack of communication or turf wars between departments (the former probably leading to the latter). If only staff and departments could contribute to databases, contracts and other documents the way programmers use <a title="GitHub" href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. And! What if they were by default open source. At minimum, shared access across all departments for employees.</p>
<h3 id="connectedness-gov">Connectedness : @Gov</h3>
<p>The best thing about the internet is the ease in which it allows us to share. Your friends on Twitter and Facebook may share <strong>too</strong> much, but nonetheless, social networks have made people and companies more accessible and accountable (if only for fear of Twitter storms). We want the same from our government &#8211; clear and simple ways to reach who we need.</p>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t expect or think that government should ever be on the bleeding edge of technology &#8211; that is not their role. But the current gulf is too great. I want a government a little more like the people: open source and distributed like nerds, agile and always looking to improve like a startup and connected and accountable like friends and family.</strong></p>

        
          <div class="post-header"><a href="horizontal-web.html"><h1>Horizontal Web</h1></a><ul><li>By Jessica Lord</li> <li>2013-24-01</li> <li>web dev, design</li></ul></div><p><img src="http://jlord.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/horiz-key.png" alt="key"></p>
<h3 id="css-multi-column-video-bar">CSS Multi-Column, Video Bar</h3>
<p>I needed the text to expand right in columns in a predetermined area of the page subject to change depending on if the video bar is toggled on and off. Video bar should be the width of the site and not end awkwardly in the middle. The path I took to making this work is what I discuss below, ignoring a lot of the overflow, white-space and other tribulations. The site also does a few other things like respond to your screen and at 1024px and under the video bar is eliminated and &#8216;video&#8217; in the menu no longer toggles the bar but becomes a link to a video page. But those weren&#8217;t as finicky as these other bits.</p>
<h4 id="issue-force-columns-to-expand-right">Issue: Force Columns to Expand Right</h4>
<p>Multi-column, and it seems the web in general, wants to expand down &#8211; not right. The only way I found to constrain the multi-column element <code>#entries</code> where I wanted it and force it to expand right was to wrap it in a container <code>#entryWrapper</code> with padding . There is a max-height option, which I may or may not have tried, it&#8217;s a haze, but in the end I chose to keep all constraining forces together in <code>#entryWrapper</code>.</p>
<p>On <code>#entries</code> I&#8217;m using <code>column-width: 300px;</code> so that it generates as many columns as it needs (rather than prescribing a number of columns with <code>column-count: x;</code>). Note, it uses this as a min-width suggestion and in my case generated columns that are 387px wide. I&#8217;m happy to say that the column-gap will remain true to you.</p>
<h4 id="issue-no-self-awareness">Issue: No Self Awareness</h4>
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve got the columns constrained to where we want them on the page and they&#8217;re expanding right, we must solve the issue that it <code>#entries</code> has no idea how many columns it&#8217;s generated and how wide that&#8217;s made it or its parent <code>#entryWrapper</code>. This means other children like <code>#videoWrapper</code> won&#8217;t fill to match this unknown width.</p>
<p>So I set empty span &#8220;markers&#8221; at the start <code>#theStart</code> and end <code>#theEnd</code> of the text in <code>#entries</code>. I then used jquery to find the distance between the two, adjusting for negative numbers if the page has been scrolled right and the remaining column width to the right of <code>#theEnd</code>.</p>
<pre>var start = Math.abs($('#theStart').offset().left)
var end = ($('#theEnd').offset().left) + 400
var pageWidth = start + end</pre>

<p>I use this the give <code>#videoWrapper</code> a width on load and when the video bar is toggled on and off (because when the text has more or less vertical space, it takes up more or less horizontal space).</p>
<p>Also, forget having any control over things like particular columns or every other column or nth column&#8230;</p>
<h4 id="issue-firefox">Issue: Firefox</h4>
<p>While Firefox supports the multi-column in general, it doesn&#8217;t seem to support <code>column-break-before</code> or <code>column-break-after</code>, which is a shame, because in webkit that&#8217;s how you can tell it to avoid breaking in the middle of lists or block quotes and to always break for new posts.</p>
<p>Those damn scrollbars. In webkit I can hide the scrollbar <code>::-webkit-scrollbar {height: 0px; width: 0px;}</code> and keep things looking the way I want while still having scrolling available through trackpad, mice, arrow keys or on-screen arrow clicks. Since the scrolling element is behind the right and left column navigation elements, in Firefox the scrollbar was awkwardly cut off on each end and made the center portion of the page however many pixels taller than the two right and left elements. Not wanting to use major plugins for dealing with scroll bars I sacrificed some of the single-frame experience of the page and used jquery to check for Firefox and then change the CSS structure so that the entire page scrolled and a more tolerable-full-screen-width scrollbar is used.</p>
<h3 id="tell-me-there-is-a-better-way">Tell Me There is a Better Way</h3>
<p>Things seems fairly straightforward now, but it was quite a process. I did a lot of internet-researching, friend&#8217;s brains picking and general starting over and trying again before I came to these solutions. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be many horizontal reading-based (not just photography portfolios) websites out there &#8211; perhaps there is a reason. I&#8217;ll also mention that I was very much trying to keep the site as light and simple as I could. I didn&#8217;t want to bulk up on plugins or write mega js to parse text and generate columns. I like it being mostly CSS and 69 lines of jquery (half of which is unrelated to columns and scrolling right but handles toggling of the video bar and menu navigation) But, alas, there now exists one! A horizontal reading site! Push the web right!</p>
<p>But seriously, share experiences and insights, please.</p>

Below are the other things.</p>
<h3 id="new-features">New Features</h3>
<p>Yay!</p>
<h4 id="tables-pagination-multi-table-sorting-and-filtering">Tables: Pagination, Multi Table Sorting and Filtering</h4>
<p>Tables can now be paginated so that you don&#8217;t have to display your entire spreadsheet of data in one go. Unless you want to.</p>
<p>Tables now supports having multiple tables with sorting and filtering. So long as you keep your table IDs straight, you&#8217;re golden.</p>
See: <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js/demos/demo-table.html">table demo</a>
<h4 id="maps-polygons-and-lines">Maps: Polygons and Lines</h4>
<p>Maps now support polygons and lines. So long as you have the correct coordinate structure in your cells, Sheetsee will add them to the geoJSON it creates for your maps. More details for coordinates of lines and polygons in geoJSON are <a href="http://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson.html">here</a>, but briefly:</p>
<p>A linestring:</p>
<pre><code>[-122.41722106933594, 37.7663045891584], [-122.40477561950684, 37.77695634643178]</code></pre>
<p>A polygon:</p>
<pre><code>[-122.41790771484375, 37.740381166384914], [-122.41790771484375, 37.74520008134973], [-122.40966796874999, 37.74520008134973],[-122.40966796874999, 37.740381166384914], [-122.41790771484375, 37.740381166384914]</code></pre>
<p>A Multipolygon:</p>
<pre><code>[[-122.431640625, 37.79106586542567], [-122.431640625, 37.797441398913286], [-122.42666244506835, 37.797441398913286],[-122.42666244506835, 37.79106586542567], [-122.431640625, 37.79106586542567]],
[[-122.43352890014648, 37.78197638783258], [-122.43352890014648, 37.789031004883654], [-122.42443084716797, 37.789031004883654], [-122.42443084716797, 37.78197638783258], [-122.43352890014648, 37.78197638783258]]</code></pre>
<p>See: <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js/demos/demo-map.html">map demo</a>.</p>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<p>I redid the documentation and website for Sheetsee. Instead of one <em>gigantic</em> readme file/website, all of the different elements are given their own file/page. Now you can find docs, demos, tips and such all filed away nicely here in the <a href="http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js">repository</a> and on the <a href="http://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js">website</a>.</p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>The other big thing that has happened to Sheetsee is that I&#39;ve taken each component (core, maps, tables and charts) and made them into their own Node.js module. This makes for smaller, more manageable code files and it makes it so that users can build their own version of Sheetsee with just the elements they want to use. For instance, if you&#39;re only making maps, just build a Sheetsee with the map component.</p>
<p>All builds come with the <code>sheetsee-core</code> module which contains all of the data organizing functions.</p>
<p>The module <code>sheetsee</code> is a command line module that builds your custom sheetsee for you.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not interested in Node modules or building anything, that&#39;s ok, too. I&#39;ll always keep a full build (with all the components) here in <a href="https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js/tree/master/js">the sheetsee.js repository</a> (which from here on out exists to be the consolidated documentation and source of a full build).</p>
<p>If you need to file an issue for a bug or feature, try and file it on the repository with the component it relates to (they each have their own repository now):</p>
