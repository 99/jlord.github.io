We had a glorious 3 weeks in Copenhagen with the best summer weather. On the first weekend, along with friends, we took a bike trip to North Zealand (the island in which Copenhagen is on). On the way we biked along the coastâ€”amazing views (Sweden!) and this Arne Jacobsen Petrol station.


We stopped by palaces along the way of course. The [Hermitage](http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/the-hermitage-gdk492183) inside of what is now a park and deer roam free.
