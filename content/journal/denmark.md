We had a glorious 3 weeks in Copenhagen with the best summer weather. On the first weekend, along with friends, we took a bike trip to North Zealand (the island in which Copenhagen is on). On the way we biked along the coast—amazing views (Sweden!) and this Arne Jacobsen Petrol station.

We stopped by palaces along the way of course. The [Hermitage](http://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/the-hermitage-gdk492183) inside of what is now a park and deer roam free.
