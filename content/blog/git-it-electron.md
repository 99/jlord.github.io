It's a great new Git-it day! Today I retire the original Git-it and (finally) release the new Git-it, a desktop app built with [Electron](), and make it the one I maintain henceforth.

It's hard to believe it's been more than two years, but lot is staying the same. The challenges and the [page of Git-it completers](http://jlord.us)—that's all still the same. The original Git-it, which is based on the [workshopper]() module and pairs with a web guide, will stay up for posterity. I've turned off issues and updated the readme to point to the new one, or the original readme if you're still interested—because it still works.

But the new one is great! This new Git-it is a desktop app that works on Mac, Windows and Linux because it's now built on Electron. The web guide has essentially become the app—though it's been refreshed and polished—with the verifying built in.

Give it a go! I'll now dive into some development chatter.
