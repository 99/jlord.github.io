This is a kind of friend request. I've moved to a new town and am making a point to get off of the computer more. Also, I've  managed to not have a nearby girl friend for too many years—so let's be friends!

Holler at me if you like some of these things, too.

#### JS & Open Source
Building tools to lower barriers for others, let's hack together. [GitHub](http://github.com/jlord)!

#### Architecture, Industrial Design & Urban Design
My degree is in architecture and I love the science of cities. [Jan Gehl](http://gehlarchitects.com) and [Enrique Peñalosa](https://www.ted.com/talks/enrique_penalosa_why_buses_represent_democracy_in_action) are my heroes.

#### Cooking
Heidi Swanson's [101 Cookbooks](http://www.101cookbooks.com) is my go-to and [Sarah Britton](http://mynewroots.org) (My New Roots) and [Anna Jones](http://annajones.co.uk), too.

#### Sewing & Making
I love it. I love finding places like [Purl Bee](http://www.purlbee.com) that offer well documented guides and used to maintain a sewing blog, [ECAB](http://www.ecabonline.com).

#### Fashion, Celebrities & Nails
Red carpet gowns! Any dress from [Elie Saab](http://www.style.com/fashion-shows/fall-2014-couture/elie-saab). I zen out watching [Lisa Eldridge](http://www.lisaeldridge.com) [#nailconf](https://instagram.com/explore/tags/nailconf/)!

#### Interiors and Shops
I love [Remodelista](http://www.remodelista.com) and their shop guides are my first stop before visiting a new city.  

#### Also—riding bikes, walking, coffee, flea markets, thinking about jogging but not jogging, BBC history podcasts, BBC history documentaries.
