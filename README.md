This is my website! It's a static site hosted for free on GitHub Pages(1). It uses [Balrog](http://www.github.com/jlord/balrog) to generate the static files.

(1)Fun! GitHub will host any website files on a branch named `master` (the default) in a repository, named with the following convention: `username.github.io`. See this one!
